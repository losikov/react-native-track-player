/**
 * The check the Detox suite cannot make: does the player fetch the audio the caller asked for?
 *
 * `audio-sync-precision-{en,es,fr}` in the app repo prove that the marker, the cue file and the
 * clock agree with each other. They cannot prove that the *sound* agrees with any of them, and
 * that is exactly the shape the bug this file exists for had: ExoPlayer 2.19.1 seeks a CBR MP3
 * through the `Info` frame's 100-entry, one-byte-per-entry table of contents, lands up to several
 * seconds away, and then stamps the first sample with the time that was *asked* for. Every layer
 * above it was told the truth about a lie.
 *
 * So this measures the one thing that cannot lie: the byte offset the player requests from the
 * network. For a constant-bitrate file the answer is arithmetic —
 * `firstAudioFrame + t * bitrate / 8` — and [com.doublesymmetry.kotlinaudio.players.components.CbrMp3Extractor]
 * is what makes ExoPlayer use it.
 *
 * ### The fixture
 *
 * `res/raw/cbr_tone_300s.mp3`, generated once with
 *
 * ```
 * ffmpeg -f lavfi -i sine=frequency=440:duration=300 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k -ac 2 cbr_tone_300s.mp3
 * ```
 *
 * Five minutes rather than ten only to keep 4.8 MB rather than 9.6 MB in the repository; the
 * table of contents is just as coarse either way. Its measured properties, which the constants
 * below state and [firstRequestedByteFor] relies on:
 *
 *  - ID3v2 header of 45 bytes, then the `Xing`/`Info` frame at byte 45 (417 bytes long), so the
 *    first audio frame begins at byte **462**.
 *  - 128 kbit/s → 16000 bytes of audio per second; one frame is 417 or 418 bytes.
 *  - The `Info` frame carries the table-of-contents flag and a full 100-byte table. Interpolating
 *    through it puts a seek up to **1.57 s — about 25000 bytes — away** from the right place, worst
 *    at t≈243 s. That is 60 times the tolerance asserted here, so this test fails loudly without
 *    the extractor and passes with it; it is not a test that happens to be satisfied either way.
 *
 * Regenerating the fixture at a different length or bitrate invalidates the constants, and the
 * first assertion in [givenCbrMp3_whenSeeking_thenRequestsTheArithmeticByteOffset] says so rather
 * than failing obscurely later.
